description: Rules for language, spelling, and prose style.

# Language & Style

- Use British English spellings (e.g. "optimisation", "colour")
- Apply semantic line breaks in prose (break lines at natural clause/phrase boundaries)
- Prefer curly quotes " " over straight quotes "
- Use italics for publication titles (e.g., *A Christmas Carol*) instead of quotes.
