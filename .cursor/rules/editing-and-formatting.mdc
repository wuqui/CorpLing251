# Code/Text Edits

- When output is long and mostly identical, show only the lines that need to be changed, and `// ... existing code ...` markers in between
- When the user asks for formatting, leave the content as is
- Consolidate multi-line bullets when possible:
    ```markdown
    - **example**: detail A, detail B (with parenthetical notes)
    ```

# Formatting Rules

- Bullet points:
    - No initial capitals unless full sentences
    - Sub-bullets: 4-space indentation
    - Prefer `-` for bullets in Markdown over, e.g. `*`
- Examples: 
    - Keep *asterisks* for linguistic forms (object language)
    - Preserve code formatting (e.g. `INFLUENCER_n`)
- Headings:
    - Add empty lines before and after all headings
    - This applies to all heading levels (#, ##, ###, ####)
    - Use H1 (#) for main sections when using title frontmatter
- Indentation:
    - Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation in bullet points
    - Note: Automated indentation changes may not work reliably; manual adjustment may be needed
- Quotes:
    - Replace Markdown blockquotes (`>`) with regular quoted paragraphs (e.g. "text...").
