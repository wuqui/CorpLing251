# Image Handling

- Store images in the `att` folder
- Use minimal image references in markdown: `![](att/filename.png)`
- Remove image descriptions from markdown image references
- Use hyphens instead of spaces in image filenames
- Convert Obsidian `![[wikilinks]]` to Quarto-compatible Markdown links.
    - Rename files with spaces to use hyphens.
    - **Example**: `![[Pasted image 123.png]]` becomes `![](att/Pasted-image-123.png)`

# Quarto Workflow

- Always preview changes to `.qmd` or `.md` files intended for Quarto output.
- After previewing and confirming, render the file(s) to ensure output is up-to-date.
- Stage, commit, and push all relevant source files and rendered output.
