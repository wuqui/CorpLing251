    "section": "3.1 Introduction to corpus linguistics",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction to corpus linguistics\n\n3.1.1 What is corpus linguistics about?\n\nCorpus linguistics is a research methodology within the field of linguistics that focuses on the systematic study of language using large and diverse collections of authentic texts, known as corpora.\nThese collections of language data, either written or spoken, provide a comprehensive and empirical basis for the analysis of\n\nlanguage use (e.g. collocational patterns such as pretty woman)\nlinguistic variation across different text types or communities (e.g. neologisms such as smash)\nlanguage change (e.g. going to future)\n\nThe primary goal of corpus linguistics is to investigate linguistic phenomena and patterns by examining real-world language usage.\n\nThis approach contrasts with more traditional linguistic methods that rely heavily on introspection and theoretical speculation (e.g. Chomsky).\n\nCorpus linguistics has gained significant momentum in recent years, thanks to advances\n\nin data\n\ne.g. social media and web corpora like Twitter and Reddit\n\nmethods\n\ne.g. social network analysis, machine learning\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 What is corpus linguistics good for?\nCorpus linguistics is a usage-based approach to linguistic analysis.\n\nCorpus linguistics is highly valuable from a usage-based approach to linguistics, as it emphasizes the importance of actual language use in shaping linguistic knowledge and structure.\nThe usage-based perspective posits that linguistic structure and knowledge emerge from the patterns and regularities that speakers encounter in their experience with language.\n\nIn this context, corpus linguistics provides a powerful toolset for investigating these patterns and regularities, offering several advantages:\n\nAuthentic language data\n\nCorpus linguistics relies on large and diverse collections of authentic texts, which represent real-world language use.\nThis ensures that the patterns and structures uncovered through corpus analysis are grounded in genuine linguistic behavior, rather than relying on idealized or artificial examples.\n\nQuantitative approach\n\nCorpus linguistics allows for the quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena, such as frequency counts and statistical measures.\nThis enables researchers to identify and describe patterns and regularities that emerge from language use, supporting the usage-based claim that linguistic structure is shaped by frequency and distributional patterns in the input.\n\nCollocations and constructions\n\nThe usage-based approach posits that language is composed of form-meaning pairings, known as constructions, which range from morphemes and words to idiomatic expressions and complex syntactic structures.\nCorpus linguistics offers tools for identifying and analyzing collocations and constructions in large datasets, contributing to our understanding of the relationships between form, meaning, and use.\n\nVariability and context sensitivity\n\nCorpus linguistics enables the examination of language use across different contexts, genres, and registers.\nThis allows researchers to investigate how linguistic features and structures vary and adapt to different situations, providing insights into the dynamic nature of language and its sensitivity to context, which is a key aspect of the usage-based approach.\n\nLanguage change and development\n\nCorpus linguistics can be applied to diachronic and synchronic data, allowing researchers to track language change over time and compare different stages of language development.\nThis helps to shed light on the emergence and evolution of linguistic structures, which is of particular interest to usage-based theorists who seek to explain language change as a result of cumulative changes in usage patterns.\n\nData-driven language teaching and language learning\n\nThe usage-based approach emphasizes the importance of exposure to authentic language input in the acquisition process.\nCorpus linguistics can inform the development of language teaching materials and methods, by providing insights into the most frequent and relevant structures, vocabulary, and collocations that learners need to acquire.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Key concepts in corpus linguistics\n\nCorpus\n\nA corpus is a large, structured collection of texts that serves as the basis for linguistic analysis. Corpora can be general, representing a wide variety of language use, or specialized, focusing on specific genres, registers, or domains. Monitor corpora such as NOW can be used to track language use until the present day.\n\nAnnotation\n\nAnnotation refers to the process of adding metadata or linguistic information to a corpus, such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic structure, or semantic roles. This additional information can facilitate more in-depth and accurate analyses.\n\nConcordance\n\nA concordance is a tool that allows researchers to search for specific words, phrases, or patterns in a corpus and display the results in context. This helps researchers to examine language patterns and identify trends across various texts.\n\nCollocations\n\nCollocation refers to the co-occurrence of words within a specific context or proximity. Studying collocations can reveal important information about word usage, meaning, and associations.\n\nFrequency\n\nFrequency analysis involves counting the occurrences of linguistic features, such as words or structures, within a corpus. This helps researchers identify patterns and trends, as well as compare language use across different corpora.\n\nN-grams\n\nN-grams are sequences of n contiguous words or linguistic units within a text. They can be used to study word combinations, patterns, and structures in a corpus.\n\nExample: The cat sat on the mat.\nExample corpus: Google N-grams\n\n\nRegister\n\nRegister refers to the language variety used in specific contexts or situations, characterized by particular linguistic features, such as vocabulary, grammar, and style. Examining registers can help researchers understand language variation and adaptation.\nA type of text type variation\n\nMetadata: data about language use on several levels:\n\nCorpus\n\nTexts: author, text type, register, topic\n\nRunning words (tokens): word class, lemmatization"
